the full amount candidate would have charged CoLab for the 100
hours of work done towards capital investment in case the “$50
USD per hour” option was taken.

The Member Body may choose to ignore any or all of the criteria
stated above, upon consensus.

### Section 1.3  Acceptance of Member-Owners

empowered hiring committee appointed by the interested subset

established or ignored by the interested subset of the Member
Body, shall give an offer of Member-Ownership to the potential
Member-Owner.
