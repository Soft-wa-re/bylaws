## ARTICLE IV: MEETINGS

### Section 4.1 Meetings

Regular Member-Owner meetings shall be held annually beginning January 1st, 9999. Stated clearly, Minnesota state law requires 308B Cooperative Corporations to set a regular Member-Owners' meeting at a time determined by the board or provided by the bylaws. Here the bylaws set the regular date beginning in the inconcievable future.
