Invested Member by (1) first-class or second-class mail to the last
address of the Invested Member shown on the Cooperative's records,
and (2) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the
Cooperative, any assets left after payment of all debts and Invested
Member Account balances shall be distributed to all persons
who were Invested Members, in proportion to the Invested Members'
account balances. No distribution need be made to any person who
fails to acknowledge the receipt of notice of liquidation in a timely
manner. Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified
mail, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets,
to the person's last known business or residence.

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the
Cooperative, any Remaining Liabilities or debt left after payments
from the sale of the assets shall be due and payable by all persons
who were Invested Members at the time of the dissolution, in proportion
to the Invested Members' relative paid labor for the previous and
current fiscal year with the Cooperative.  Credit balances in any
Invested Member Accounts will be paid only after all debt and
liabilities have been paid.

The order of repayment will be as follows: Debt and liabilities
(e.g. vendors, landlord, employees, etc.) to Provisional Members,
then debts and liabilities to Working Members, then to Invested Member
Accounts, starting with earliest-joined Invested Member and proceeding
then to the next member remaining in the order of becoming an Invested Member.
