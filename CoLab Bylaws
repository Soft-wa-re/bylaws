The Board of Directors, without member or stockholder approval, is granted the express authority, by resolution, to establish from the undesignated shares one or more classes or series of shares, to designate each class or series, and to fix and establish the designations, powers, preferences, and governance and veto rights, including member or stockholder voting rights and rights to appoint or elect directors to the Board, qualifications, limitations or restrictions of each additional class of stock (and the corresponding obligation to fix and establish these designations, powers, preferences, governance and other rights, qualifications, limitations and restrictions whenever any additional class is established). The power of the Board extends to and includes the express authority to create classes and series, without member or stockholder approval, which have terms granting the additional class and/or series (and the holders of thereof) rights, powers, preferences and privileges greater than the rights, powers, preferences and privileges associated with any previously established and designated class or series, including but not limited to, creating patron and non-patron class and series designations. The rights, powers, preferences and privileges are the same for all series within a class except as expressly provided otherwise in the class designation approved by the Board, or the subscription or other agreement regarding the series approved by the Board.  In no case may the patrons’ interest in governance rights be reduced below 75% of the governance rights of all patron and non-patron members.

5.2 Patron Voting and Financial Rights.  Patron stock shall not be less than 75% of all of the voting power of capital stock, nor shall Patron stock be allocated less than 30% of the financial rights.

5.3 Member Action. The members shall take action by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the voting power of the shares represented and voting at a duly held meeting, except where the affirmative vote of a greater number of the affirmative vote of a majority of the voting power of all voting shares is required by statute, and except where the holders of a class or series are entitled by statute to vote as a class or series whether or not such holders are otherwise entitled to vote.

5.4 No Preemptive Rights. The members of this association shall have no preemptive rights to subscribe for or otherwise acquire any new or additional shares of stock of this corporation of any class whether now authorized or authorized hereafter, or any options or warrants to purchase, subscribe for or otherwise acquire any such new or additional shares of any class, or any shares, bonds, notes, debentures, or other securities convertible into or carrying options or warrants to purchase, subscribe for, or otherwise acquire any such new or additional shares of any class.

ARTICLE VI
Net Income and Loss

  The net income of the association in excess of dividends on equity capital and additions to reserves shall be distributed to members and nonmember patrons annually or more often on the basis of patronage and the records of the association may show the interest of members and nonmember patrons in the reserves.  Patronage may be different for Members and nonmember patrons delivering into different patronage pools or allocation units as determined by the Board of Directors.  Net income may be accounted for and distributed on the basis of allocation units that may be functional, divisional, departmental, geographic, or otherwise.  Net income may be distributed in cash, credits, allocated patronage equities, revolving fund certificates, securities of the corporation, other securities, or any combination thereof.  Any such allocated equity shall be redeemable only at the option of the Board of Directors.  The net loss of an allocation unit or units may be offset against the net income of other allocation units to the extent permitted by law.  The net income or net loss of the association or any allocation unit may be determined by including the association’s proportionate share of the net income or loss of other entities in which the association owns an equity interest.  The foregoing provisions of this Article shall be implemented as more particularly provided in the Bylaws of the corporation.

ARTICLE VII

The association shall be governed by its Board of Directors which shall be not less than three (3), unless the number of members exceeds fifty (50), in which case the Board shall be not less than five (5).
