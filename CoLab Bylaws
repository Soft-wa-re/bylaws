Regular Member-Owner meetings shall be held annually as determined by the consensus of the Member Body, defaulted to January 1st, 9999. Stated clearly, Minnesota state law requires 308A Cooperative Corporations to set a regular Member-Owners' meeting at a time determined by the board. This board (the previously defined Member-Body) elects to forego this requirement by deciding on a regular date beginning in the inconcievable future.

ARTICLE V:  OFFICERS

Section 5.1  Titles

The amount of the bonuses is to be determined by the Board but in any case shall be in compliance with all applicable laws.

(b) The Cooperative, in settling a Member Account, shall have the right to set off any and all indebtedness of the former Member to the Corporation.

Section 7.5  Periodic Payment of Member Accounts

The Cooperative shall aim to pay out to the Members all funds in their Member Accounts within one (1) year of the date they were first credited. As a general rule, written notices of allocation credited to Member Accounts (including notices now converted to debt) will be paid-out in the order in which they are credited, the oldest paid-out first; however, the Board can decide to accelerate the repayment of debt owed to former Members.  If the Cooperative does not allot sufficient funds to pay-out all funds credited to Member Accounts for a given fiscal year, then a proportionate dollar amount of funds credited to Members will be paid-out.

Section 7.6  Unclaimed Equity Interests

Any proprietary interest in the Corporation held by a Member that would otherwise escheat to the State the Member is living in as unclaimed personal property shall instead become the property of the Corporation if the Corporation gives at least 60 days prior notice of the proposed transfer to the affected Member by (1) first-class or second-class mail to the last address of the Member shown on the Corporation's records, and (2) by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the Corporation has its principal office.  No property or funds shall become the property of the Corporation under this section if written notice objecting to the transfer is received by the Corporation from the affected Member prior to the date of the proposed transfer.

Section 7.7  Dissolution Distributions and Remaining Liabilities

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the Corporation, any assets left after payment of all debts and Member-Owner Account balances shall be distributed to all persons who were Collaborator Members, in proportion to the Collaborator Members' account balances. No distribution need be made to any person who fails to acknowledge the receipt of notice of liquidation in a timely manner.  Said notice shall be deemed sufficient if sent by certified mail, at least 30 days before distribution of any residual assets, to the person's last know business or residence.

Upon liquidation, dissolution, or sale of the assets of the Corporation, any Remaining Liabilities or debt left after payments from the sale of the assets shall be due and payable by all persons who were Member-Owners at the time of the dissolution, in proportion to the Member-Owners' relative paid labor for the previous and current fiscal year with the Cooperative.  Credit balances in any Collaborator Member or Member-Owner Accounts will be paid only after all debt and liabilities have been paid.  
The order of repayment will be as follows: Debt and liabilities to non-Members (e.g. vendors, landlord, employees, etc.), then Member-Owner Accounts, starting with oldest Member-Owner and proceeding then to the next member remaining in the order of becoming a Member-Owner, finally Collaborator Members. 

Section 7.8  Maintaining Equitable Membership Fees

In order to insure that Membership in the Corporation may remain accessible for persons of modest means, the Corporation will consider flexible options, such as work-trade at a lower wage, with some of the work hours contributing to the membership fee.
