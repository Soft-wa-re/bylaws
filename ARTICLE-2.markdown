## ARTICLE II:  TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP

### Section 2.1  Voluntary Withdrawal

A Member may withdraw from the Cooperative by providing written notice of withdrawal to the CoLab Board which will result in automatic termination of the Member’s membership in CoLab. The Cooperative shall terminate the Member’s membership effective immediately upon receipt of the Member’s written notice of withdrawal.

### Section 2.2  Death

A Membership shall immediately terminate upon the death of a Member.

### Section 2.3  Expulsion

(a)	A Member may for any lawful reason be expelled from CoLab by unanimous consensus of the Member Body.

(b)	Any appeal will be considered by the Member Body to decide that the proposed expulsion not take place. Unless the Member Body decides by consensus to stop the termination, the expulsion will be effective five days following the meeting to hear the appeal or fifteen days after the initial notice, whichever is later.

(c)	The Member Body may direct a Member under expulsion order to refrain from conducting business as a Member until the termination action is resolved provided CoLab pays the Member her or his unpaid wages -- until resolution is reached. The Member Body may also direct the Member under expulsion order to stay off CoLab property except as necessary by law.

#### Section 2.4 Effect of Termination

(a) Membership. On the date that a Member provides written notice of intent to withdraw to the CoLab Board, on the date of a Member’s death, or upon the termination of his or her membership in CoLab in accordance with this Article II, all rights and interests of the Member in CoLab, including any voting rights, shall cease, except as provided in these Bylaws. 

(b) Redemption. The terminated Member or the deceased Member's estate shall be entitled to redemption of the price paid by the Member for the Member’s Patron Member Share and the balance of the Member’s Member Account, less any obligation owed to CoLab by the Member (the “Redemption Price”). No redemption under this Article II may be made if it would render CoLab unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or causes the remaining assets of CoLab to be less than its liabilities. However, CoLab shall redeem the terminated or deceased Member’s Patron Member Share if and when the redemption of the Member’s Patron Member Share will not render CoLab unable to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business or cause the remaining assets of CoLab to be less than its liabilities. The Redemption Price shall be paid using cash or promissory note or some combination of the two and the CoLab Board shall comply with any redemption policies created by the Board when redeeming Patron Member shares under this Article II.

(c) If the terminated or withdrawing Member serves on the Member Body or is a director, termination of that person’s membership will automatically result in termination of that person’s position on the Member Body or as a director. Termination or withdrawal of Membership does not automatically result in the termination of the person’s employment with CoLab.
