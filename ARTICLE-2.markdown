An Invested Member, Working Member, or Provisional Member shall have the
right to resign from the Cooperative, effective immediately without any
action on the part of the Cooperative.

When an Invested Member resigns, their initial capital contribution will
be returned immediately or deferred to installments depending on the
Board's determination concerning the Collective Account (see Article 7)
and the Cooperative's strategic planning. The Board has 30 days to come
to a decision whether to return the ICC immediately or to defer to
installments. If deferred installments are chosen, the terms shall be
decided at the same time. The terms shall last no longer than 1 year
after the Member has resigned.

### Section 2.2  Death

A Membership shall immediately terminate upon the death of a Member.

(a)	A Member may for any lawful reason be expelled from the
        Cooperative by unanimous-consensus-minus-one of the Board.
        If the Member in question is a member of the Board, the Board
        must come to unanimous-consensus-minus-two.

(b)	Any appeal will be considered by the Board to decide that
        the proposed expulsion not take place. Unless the Board
        decides by consensus to stop the termination, the expulsion will
        be effective five days following the meeting to hear the appeal
        or fifteen days after the initial notice, whichever is later.

(d)	The Board may direct a Member under expulsion order to
        refrain from conducting business as a Member until the
        termination action is resolved provided the Cooperative pays the
        Member their unpaid wages -- until resolution is reached.
        The Board may also direct the Member under expulsion order
        to stay off Cooperative property except as necessary by law.
