## ARTICLE II:  TERMINATION OF MEMBERSHIP

### Section 2.1  Voluntary Withdrawal

A Member shall have the right to resign from the Cooperative, effective
immediately without any action on the part of the Cooperative.

Initial capital contribution will be returned immediately if the
Collective Account (see Article 7) is deemed sufficient to support the
return. Otherwise, initial capital contribution will be returned in
installments such that the Collective Account can support it.

### Section 2.2  Death

A Membership shall immediately terminate upon the death of a Member.

### Section 2.3  Expulsion

(a)	A Member may for any lawful reason be expelled from the
        Cooperative by unanimous consensus of the Member Body.

(b)	Any appeal will be considered by the Member Body to decide that
        the proposed expulsion not take place.  Unless the Member Body
        decides by consensus to stop the termination, the expulsion will
        be effective five days following the meeting to hear the appeal
        or fifteen days after the initial notice, whichever is later.

(d)	The Member Body may direct a Member under expulsion order to
        refrain from conducting business as a Member until the
        termination action is resolved provided the Cooperative pays the
        Member her or his unpaid wages -- until resolution is reached.
        The Member Body may also direct the Member under expulsion order
        to stay off Cooperative property except as necessary by law.
