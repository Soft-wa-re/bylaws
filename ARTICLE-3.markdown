## ARTICLE III:  MEMBERSHIP CONSENSUS

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Acceptance of a new Member-Owner,

(b)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of Member-Owners
	as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions, property
	rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the
	Memberships;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Memberships

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full
consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making
matters with a goal of seeking consensus. If it becomes apparent that consensus
cannot be reached in time for the decision to be relevant or beneficial, the
Member Body or interested subset will take action as it sees fit, and will
apologize to the full membership that consensus was not reached, and that it
will try harder next time.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not
necessary for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths
majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism.

### Section 3.14  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member
Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if
the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.

### Section 3.3 Working Groups and Organization Areas

The mebership shall have the option of establishing working grous and delegating
to those groups decision making authority in specific domains. Each such working 
group shall have a document specifying its intent, responsibilities, areas of
decision making, and core membership.

All working groups shall operate democratically, transparently and openly. Their
decision making process shall follow that of the Guiding Council, defined below.

Working groups shall construe the field of their decision making conservately, and
work to include the larger membership in decisions that might have wider impacts
through the organization.

### Section 3.4 The Guiding Council (AKA "The Board")

The membership shall form a guiding council to monitor the operations of the
cooperative, meet regularly to co-create strategic plans, author proposals for
member ratification, and manage regular affairs needing member review but not
member consensus.

The council shall meet monthly and review reports from all working groups
charged with managing the operations of the cooperative. All members shall be
welcome to participate in all council meetings.

The council shall make decisions following the same consensus process as used
for membership decisions. All council-persons and members present at a council
meeting shall be eligible to participate in the decision making processes of any
council meeting.

The council shall be responsible for decisions regarding allocation of funds,
hiring of new resources, acceptance of new clients, strategic, marketing and
branding decisions, and other governance and operational tasks not explicitly
reserved by the membership.

The council shall be formed at least annually. All members interested in participating 
in council shall consense on a set of members to be put before the membership for
ratification as the Guiding Council. The membership shall then ratify the council's
proposed formation according to the membership consensus process. Should the
membership not ratify the council, another group shall form and propose itself
as council.

Should the group of members interested in participating in council fail to consense on
a proposed council group the membership shall determine the proposed group through 
a Condorcet vote considering all members who put themselves forth. The group just formed
shall be ratified according to the membership consensus process.

In the event that no group is named council, the entire membership shall take on
the duties of the council.

The council shall consist of no fewer than 3 and no more than 11 members,
provided there are sufficient members of the cooperative. Those on the council
themselves out of council membership as frequently as pragmatically feasible. 
shall seek to recruit any members not serving to serve on future councils, and shall
rotate on and off council in a manner that provides opportunities for all to participate.
