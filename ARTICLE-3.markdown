## ARTICLE III:  MEMBERSHIP CONSENSUS

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Acceptance of a new Member-Owner,

(b)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of Member-Owners as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions, property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the Memberships;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Memberships

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making matters with a goal of seeking consensus.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not necessary for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism.

If it becomes apparent that consensus cannot be reached in time for the decision to be relevant or beneficial, the Member Body will vote on the following three options: (1) take no action on the decision, (2) put the decision to a 50% minimum vote, (3) disolve the cooperative. Following this vote, there will be a final discussion to see if the consensus can be achieved. If this attempt is not successfuly within a short period of time, the determined course of action will be followed. The vote will be determined through a ranking system and suitable participatory democratic process.

### Section 3.14  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.
