## ARTICLE III:  DECISION-MAKING

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of
        Member-Owner as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions,
        property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part
        of the Membership;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Membership

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body, the Board, and any other decision-making bodies within CoLab,
as appropriate, shall at all times attempt to approach all decision-making
matters with a goal of seeking consensus.

If they so choose, Members may elect to defer their voice in decision-making
to a delegate for a specified time or specific vote, allowing the delegate to
cast a "proxy" vote on their behalf. The delegate must be a member of the
cooperative, and the proxy vote cast by the delegate shall be considered a vote
cast by by the Member for purposes of determining consensus quorum (all eligible
members must vote) and final outcome. Members may exercise this option to allow
decision making processes to proceed in their absence or for decisions
they wish to remove themselves from for any reason. It is assumed that 
delegates will vote in accordance with the expressed wishes of the delegating
member, to the best of their ability.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not
necessary or possible for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with
three-fourths majority vote, with decreasing majorities being decreasingly
acceptable. The worst possible alternative is simple majority.

If it appears that consensus may not be reached in time for the decision to be
timely or relevant any Member can call a vote to determine if an alternate
decision making process may be invoked. In such a vote, the decision-making body
will vote on the following three options:

(1) Continue with the consensus process.

(2) Defer to the decision of the Board.

The decision should be made by Condorcet Vote, followed by discussion and if
necessary, re-vote in case of a tie.

In the case that the need for a entire-cooperative-affecting decision is
imminent and after 24 hours following the calling of a membership decision
process vote there is no conclusive result, the Board shall have the option
of invoking emergency executive powers, though they must offer the membership
an apology upon taking action, which shall include an explanation of the need
for proceeding without member ratification and steps taken to ensure any
demonstrated concerns of membership were taken into account. This stipulation
does not apply to amendments or changes to these bylaws as specified in
Section 3.1, which must always be ratified by the full membership.

### Section 3.3  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the
decision-making body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting
depending on if the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.

### Section 3.4 The Board

The membership shall form a Board to monitor the operations of the
cooperative, meet regularly to co-create strategic plans, author proposals for
member ratification, and manage regular affairs deemed more impactful than
the Org Areas (see below) have authority to manage, but not yet so impactful
as to require entire membership consensus. The Board shall work to include all
substantially impacted members in all decision making processes.

The Board shall meet monthly and review reports from all Org Areas
charged with managing the operations of the cooperative. All members shall be
welcome to attend all Board Meetings without voting participation.

Two-thirds of the Board members constitutes a quorum for Board meetings.

A simple majority of the members constitutes a quorum at a meeting of the
Member Body.

All strategic, Coop-wide decisions shall be made by the Board, except that the
following acts require voting by the Member Body:

* Acceptance of new Invested Members;
* Election of or changes to the qualifications or number of Board members;
* Bylaw changes that would materially affect the rights or obligations of
  members at any level as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer,
  distributions, patronage property rights, or rights to repayment of
  contributed capital;
* Bylaws changes to membership definitions

The full minutes recorded during the Board meeting shall be made available
to all Invested Members within 24 hours of the Board meeting.

A redacted version, with sensitive financial, legal, and personnel
information removed, will be available to Provisional and Working Members
within 48 hours of the meeting. 

The Board shall make decisions following the same consensus process as
described in Section 3.2.

The Board shall be elected annually by a vote of members of all membership
levels, using the Simple Transferable Vote process.

In the event of a vacancy on the Board (for example, if an elected Board
member loses their CoLab membership), the Board will call a new Board election.

The Board shall consist 7 elected Invested Members and 2 elected Working
Members, provided there are sufficient members of the cooperative. Those
on the Board shall seek to engage members not serving to serve on future
Boards, and shall rotate themselves out of elections for the Board
membership as frequently as pragmatically feasible in a manner that provides
opportunities for all coop members to participate.

Board members may present decisions on Loomio (or any other tool agreed
upon by the Board) for Board approval. Board members are expected to vote
within a period of 7 days. If any Board member choses not to vote, the
definition of consensus will be considered as consensus among those who voted.

### Section 3.5 Org Areas and Working Groups

The membership shall have the option of establishing subsets of the
membership called "Org Areas" and delegating decision making authority to
those Org Areas in specific domains.

Org Areas shall have Lead positions who are responsible for the day-to-day
operations of the Org Area responsibilities as well as forming the Working
Groups (see below) necessary for decisions beyond the scope of day-to-day
operations. The Org Area's responsibilities and authority shall be agreed
upon by consensus of the membership. The Org Area's Lead position shall be
filled by an Invested Member or a Working Member, and shall be agreed upon
by the Board.

A document specifying the intent, responsibilities, areas of decision making,
and Org Area Lead shall be created for each Org Area.

Org Areas shall construe the field of their decision making conservatively, 
and work to include the larger membership in decisions that might have wider
impacts through the organization. Decisions that are deemed impactful to
a larger group than the Org Area shall be reported to the Guiding Council
in a timely manner. Decisions that are deemed impactful to the entire
membership shall be brought to the Guiding Council before being taken.

When a decision that extends beyond the day-to-day operations of the Org
Area Lead is required, the Org Area Lead will announce the decision in
question to the Org Area membership, visible to all Members, in order to
solicit a working group to execute the decision. The working group will
consist of the Org Area Lead by default, but requires the addition of at
least 1 other member or collaborator. Any member or collaborator who wishes
to have a say in the decision may join the Working Group.

The Working Group will then follow the process of decision making in Section
3.2, generally attempting to find consensus.
