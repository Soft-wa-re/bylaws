## ARTICLE III:  MEMBERSHIP CONSENSUS AND GUIDING COUNCIL

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Acceptance of a new Member-Owner,

(b)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of Member-Owners as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions, property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part of the Memberships;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Memberships

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making matters with a goal of seeking consensus.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not necessary for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism.

If it appears that consensus may not be reached in time for the decision to be timely or relavent any member can call a vote to determine if an alternate decision making process may be invoked. In such a vote,  the Member Body will vote on the following three options:

(1) Continue with the consensus process.

(2) Out the decision to a member vote which shall ratify the proposal provided there are no more than 2 members or one quarter of the total membership, whichever is greater, opposed to the proposal.

(3) Defer to the decision of the council.

The decision should be made by Condorcet Vote, followed by discussion and if necessary, re-vote in case of a tie.

In the case that the need for a decision is iminent and after 24 hours following the calling of a membership decision process vote there is no conclusive result, the Guiding Council shall have the option of taking on the decision, though they must offer the membership and apology upon taking action, which shall include an explanation of the need for proceeding without member ratification and steps taken to ensure any demonstrated concerns of membership were taken into account. This stipulation does not apply to amendments or changes to these bylaws, which must always be ratified by the full membership.

### Section 3.3  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.
