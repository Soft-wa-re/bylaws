## ARTICLE III:  DECISION-MAKING

### Section 3.1  Actions Requiring Consensus of the Member Body

The following acts require consensus of the Member Body:

(a)	Acceptance of a new Member-Owner,

(b)	Bylaw changes that would

	(1)	Materially and adversely affect the rights or obligations of
        Member-Owner as to voting, dissolution, redemption, transfer, distributions,
        property rights, or rights to repayment of contributed capital;

	(2)	Affect an exchange, reclassification or cancellation of all or part
        of the Membership;

	(3)	Authorize a new class of Membership

### Section 3.2  Process of Decision-Making

The Member Body (or interested subset when deciding issues not requiring full
consensus of the Member Body) shall attempt to approach all decision-making
matters with a goal of seeking consensus.

If they so choose, Members may elect to defer their voice in
decision-making to a delegate for a specified time or specific vote,
allowing the delegate to cast a "proxy" vote on their behalf. The
delegate must be a member of the cooperative, and the proxy vote cast by
the delegate shall be considered a vote cast by by the Member for
purposes of determining consensus quorum (all elegible members must
vote) and final outcome. Members may exercise this option to allow
decision making processes to proceed in their absence or for decisions
they wish to remove themselves from for any reason. It is assumed that 
delegates will vote in accordance with the expressed wishes of the delegating
member, to the best of their ability.

Consensus may mean that consensus is reached agreeing that consensus is not
necessary for a given issue. Viable alternatives should start with three-fourths
majority vote, with decreasing acceptable egalitarianism.

If it appears that consensus may not be reached in time for the decision to be
timely or relevant any member can call a vote to determine if an alternate
decision making process may be invoked. In such a vote, the Member Body will
vote on the following three options:

(1) Continue with the consensus process.

(2) Out the decision to a member vote which shall ratify the proposal provided
there are no more than 2 members or one quarter of the total membership,
whichever is greater, opposed to the proposal.

(3) Defer to the decision of the council.

The decision should be made by Condorcet Vote, followed by discussion and if
necessary, re-vote in case of a tie.

In the case that the need for a decision is imminent and after 24 hours following
the calling of a membership decision process vote there is no conclusive result,
the Guiding Council shall have the option of taking on the decision, though they
must offer the membership an apology upon taking action, which shall include an
explanation of the need for proceeding without member ratification and steps
taken to ensure any demonstrated concerns of membership were taken into 
account. This stipulation does not apply to amendments or changes to these 
bylaws as specified in Section 3.1, which must always be ratified by the full
membership.

### Section 3.3  Use of ballots for voting in case consensus is not reached

The protocol for the use of ballots in any way may be determined by the Member
Body or by any interested subset by way of consensus or voting depending on if
the decision requires consensus as defined in Section 3.1.

### Section 3.4 The Guiding Council (AKA "The Board")

The membership shall form a guiding council to monitor the operations of the
cooperative, meet regularly to co-create strategic plans, author proposals for
member ratification, and manage regular affairs needing member review but not
member consensus.

The council shall meet monthly and review reports from all working groups
charged with managing the operations of the cooperative. All members shall be
welcome to participate in all council meetings.

The council shall make decisions following the same consensus process as used
for membership decisions. All council-persons and members present at a council
meeting shall be eligible to participate in the decision making processes of any
council meeting.

The council shall be responsible for decisions not explicitly reserved by the
membership or delegated to an Org Area. The council shall work to include all
substantially impacted members in all decision making processes.

The council shall be formed at least annually. All members interested in 
participating in council shall consense on a set of members to be put before the 
membership for ratification as the Guiding Council. The membership shall then 
ratify the council's proposed formation according to the membership consensus 
process. Should the membership not ratify the council, another group shall form 
and propose itself as council.

Should the group of members interested in participating in council fail to
consense on a proposed council group the membership shall determine the
proposed group through a Condorcet vote considering all members who put
themselves forth. The group just formed shall be ratified according to the
membership consensus process.

In the event that no group is named council, the entire membership shall take
on the duties of the council.

The council shall consist of no fewer than 3 and no more than 11 members,
provided there are sufficient members of the cooperative. Those on the council
themselves out of council membership as frequently as pragmatically feasible. 
shall seek to recruit any members not serving to serve on future councils, and 
shall rotate on and off council in a manner that provides opportunities for all
to participate.

### Section 3.5 Org Areas

The membership shall have the option of establishing subsets of the
membership called "Org Areas" and delegating decision making authority to
those Org Areas in specific domains as agreed upon by consensus of the
membership.

A document specifying the intent, responsibilities, areas of decision making,
and core membership shall be created for each Org Area.

Org Areas shall construe the field of their decision making conservatively, 
and work to include the larger membership in decisions that might have wider
impacts through the organization. Decisions that are deemed impactful to
a larger group than the Org Area shall be reported to the Guiding Council
in a timely manner. Decisions that are deemd impactful to the entire
membership shall be brought to the Guiding Council before being taken.

When a decision is required, the Org Area will announce the decision in
question to the Org Area membership, visible to all Members, in order to
solicit a working group to execute the decision. The working group will
consist of the Org Area lead by default. All interested parties from within
the Org Area and the Membership at large will then follow the process of
decision making in Section 3.2, generally attempting to find consensus.
The working group must consist of at least 2 people.
